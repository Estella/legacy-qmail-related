Subject: [simscan] ripmime --disable-qmail-bounce

Greetings,

It turns out, ripmime by default tries to detect qmail bounce messages. 
  Unfortunately, this "detection" takes an email with one 600K pdf 
attachment and 18 bounce headers, and "breaks" it into 18 unique bounce 
messages messages, each with their own 600K pdf attachment.  clamdscan 
was then trying to scan them ALL, and spiking the cpu in the process, 
and eventually timing out smtp connections.

Here's what the ripmime man page says about this feature (misspelled, 
for some reason):

######################
--disable-qmailbounce:

Turns  off  ripMIME's  look-ahead  searching  for RFC822 headers
within a body of text. Normally the  look-ahead  is  useful  for
decoding embedded emails which have been bounced back by systems
like qmail, but have been included in such a way that  they  are
not  meant  to  be  decoded, unfortunately some MUA (Outlook for
one) still decode it, hence we need  to  by  default  check  for
attachments in such forwarded bodies.
######################

(incidentally, I did a diff on the resulting 18 files - the attachment 
parts are indeed identical, only the headers are different)

Attached is a text diff for that will add the ripmime argument to 
simscan.c (v. 1.2).

Here's the time results using the QMAILQUEUE environment and the 
qmail-inject program to test the simscan process (bypassing smtp):

Without --disable-qmail-bounce:

real    5m38.363s
user    0m0.489s
sys     0m0.289s

With --disable-qmail-bounce:

real    0m34.952s
user    0m0.057s
sys     0m0.074s

That's about 1/10 of the time.  So my questions are:

Has anyone else tried this?  Are there any dangers in using this I 
haven't considered?  If not, perhaps this is a change that should be 
added to simscan.  It has greatly improved clamd performance on the 3 
machines involved in this busy system.

Regards,

Bill
